The word embeddings generated by Word2Vec are trained based on the context of words within a given corpus. While Word2Vec captures semantic relationships and similarities between words, it does not consider the positive or negative connotations of individual words.

In the case of finding the most similar words to "Good," the algorithm looks for words that frequently appear in similar contexts. However, it does not inherently understand the emotional or positive/negative associations of those words. As a result, it is possible to encounter words with negative meanings among the most similar words.

The reason for this occurrence can be attributed to the co-occurrence patterns of words in the training corpus. For example, words like "bad" or "poor" may appear in similar contexts as "good" in certain instances, leading them to be considered as similar by the Word2Vec model.
